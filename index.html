            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>The body consists of the parent body element and its child elements</li>
            <li>The body is a semantic HTML element, where the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage</li>
            <li>These child elements in the body give structure to the webpage</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS can be added three ways: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>CSS Rule consists of a selector, property, and value: ex - div {color: blue;}.  The selector defines the element to which the rules apply and the declarations contain the CSS property and the value for that property.</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Types of Variables:<br>
            <ol>
                <li>String - sequence of text enclosed in quotes</li>
                <li>number - numeric values not enclosed in quotes</li>
                <li>Boolean - True or False - Special values that do not need quotes</li>
                <li>Array - Structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference</li>
                <li>Object - Can be anything - Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable</li>
            </ol></li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code and ignored by the browser</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not.  Commonly performed with if...else statements</li>
          <li>Events are code structures that listen for activity in the browser and run code in response</li>
          <li>Array is a single variable used to hold a group of data, most often related.</li>
          <li>For Loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>Function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Functions do not automatically execute as they must be called by name</li>
