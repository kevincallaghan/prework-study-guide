# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a study guide for bootcamp students completing the course prework.  It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.  This project was built to create an environment to access helpful notes on topics that may be new to a bootcamp student to aid in the course going forward.  In building this project, I learned the basics on creating a webpage using the topics mentioned above.

## Usage

This project should be used to help learn some of the basic elemts of coding a webpage through HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.  The notes listed are helpful reminders of key facts regarding these areas, and the JavaScript running can been seen using Google's DevTools console by "inspecting" the page.  Although the information listed and the tasks used to create this project are only introductory to the course, this project serves as a good foundation to the knowledge it will take to be successful throughout the bootcamp.
